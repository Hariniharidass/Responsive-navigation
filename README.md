# Responsive-navigation

This project showcases how to build a responsive navigation menu using HTML and SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets). The navigation is designed to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML5:** Clean and accessible markup for the navigation and page content, ensuring better structure and SEO.
- **SASS (SCSS Syntax):** Utilizes SASS for organized, maintainable, and efficient stylesheets, leveraging powerful features like variables, nesting, and mixins to streamline CSS development.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Styles are developed with smaller screens in mind first, then progressively enhanced for larger viewports using CSS media queries, guaranteeing responsiveness across all devices.
- **JavaScript-Powered Hamburger Menu:** Implements a classic mobile navigation pattern that toggles the menu's visibility with a concise JavaScript snippet, improving user experience on smaller screens.
- **Modular HTML Includes:** Navigation and footer content are loaded dynamically into main pages using JavaScript, maintaining clean and modular HTML files without resorting to less ideal methods like iframes.
- **Optimized CSS Delivery:** All SASS partials are compiled into a single, comprehensive CSS file, which significantly reduces HTTP requests and enhances overall page load performance.
- **Basic Page Layouts:** Includes example pages for Home, About, Contact, and Services, demonstrating consistent navigation and styling across a multi-page website.
